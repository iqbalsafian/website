            I am a fullstack software developer with more than 14 years of working experience. I have worked for various
            small start-ups to multi-national organizations in private and government sector. I&apos;m addicted to
            coding coding that during my pass time I sneak out of the bed and start coding. PHP, Java, NodeJS are my
            backend meals and I keep my brain fat with ReactJS & Vue. I&apos;ve also worked with several other
            programming languages like .Net, ColdFusion and Python. Recently, I teach myself Golang.
